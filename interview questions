#Interview Questions

We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.
- me and two other partners had just started a business, we were excited but were lacking in experience and a client base.
- we spent a lot of time setting goals for ourselves that were reasonable. We than made plans on how long we would knock doors, network and ect.. setting expections for
ourselves and each other. 
- one of my partners struggled to meet goals and got easily discouraged which made meeting our goals much harder, i was quite frustrated and wanted all of us to succeed 
so i put a lot of pressure on him to do what we already agreed on.
- as a result he completely gave up try, i later realized my error and encouraged him rather than pressure him. I learned not everyone operates the same as myself and i learned
to be more patient and understanding of others and where their at.

Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
- we got a job to replace a roof from an old house with an extreme steep pitched roof. the customers had high expectations but couldnt afford the company they actually
wanted and ultimately went with us because we were half the cost (also no other roofer wanted to tackle this roof).
- they wanted everything to look perfect and having some roofing experience themselves they they were skeptical of our capabilities.
- we spent 2 weeks on this roof getting all the details they wanted just right. it was difficult trying to understand what the customer wanted and reassuring them we knew
what we were doing.
- We ended with the best roof job we have ever done, the before and after pictures made it look like an entirely new home. in the end we met all their expectaions and then
some.

Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
- when i was working for a smaller sales oriented company they started exploring different areas further from our normal range. They ended up being very successful in 
these new areas and we had a lot of work that required a decent amount of travel which was new to me.
- i was responsible for installing the products they sold, usually attic insulation which attics get extremely hot in the summer. we usually start very early before the attics
get super heated as to prevent heat related illness. the extra travel made this more difficult.
- i should also mention that i am a night owl not a big fan of waking up early, but i got use to waking up at 4am and getting everything prepared for driving several hours
so we could finish multiple installs in time to get home for enough sleep to do it again.
- this is when i found the ability to adapt regardless of my natural inclinations, it was hard work but ended up being quite rewarding.

Sometimes it’s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?
- balancing work and family has always felt that way to me, when going through codeworks i found i had little extra time between full time classes, daily assignments and
weekend applications to build. 
- there was a rather stressful application i was building over the weekend that required a lot more time than others, my family also wanted to go on a large exersion.
- i listed out all that i needed to get done, i planned on taking breaks when i could and go on the family exersion if i had enough completed. 
- i finished the application and took a fair amount of breaks but i did miss the exersion because i didnt complete enough in time. I was able to have some extra time in the
end for family because i stuck to my plans.

Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way at work.
- back when i was working for my business i was doing some sales and had an appointment with a not so promising potential customer.
- showing up to the appointment i found the husband rather than the wife confronting me and extremely upset that i wanted to sell them something they didnt need or want.
- i used every technique i had developed to talk him down and get him comfortable with me, i than transitioned to informing him more about what we did and how it worked.
- he eventually purchased our products and was extremely friendly towards us.

Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
- while i was working at walmarts DC they had extremely high turn over due to the difficulty of the job and its high physical demands.
- they were also trying out new training for new recruits which didnt seem very effective. Alot of the new hires were struggling to meet production standards.
- i took it upon myself to stop and help them fix mistakes they were doing and give advise on how to do things better to avoid injury and improve productivity
- those that listened to my advise quickly excelled and made less mistakes.
