### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm daniel, I'm a full-stack software developer. I come from a background in construction, with businesses management.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on boise codeworks software developer training
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MVC Pattern, Vue, Auth0, C#, and MySQL.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Food, Games and my family.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have the heart of a lion! and a life-time ban from the boise zoo.
