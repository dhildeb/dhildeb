We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.
- me and two other partners had just started a business and we needed customers.
- we knew set goals as a partnership and set plans on how to accomplish them.
- one of my partners struggled to meet goals and got easily discouraged which made things worse, i was quite frustrated and wanted all of us to succeed so i put a lot
of pressure on him to do what we already agreed on.
- as a result he completely gave up try, i realized my error and encouraged him rather than pressure him and it helped but there were long time effects from my mistake.

Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
- we got a job to replace a roof from a rather old and extreme steep pitch house. the customers had high expectations but couldnt afford the company they actually wanted and 
ultimately went with us because we were half the cost (also no other roofer wanted to tackle this roof).
- they wanted everything to look perfect and they were relunctent because they had roofing experience and thought they knew more than us.
- we spent 2 weeks on this roof getting all the details they wanted just right, there were countless times the customer would ask us to redo something 
or do it another way just to have us go back to how we were orginially doing it.
- we ended with the best roof job we have ever done, i was extremely impressed and the before and after pictures made it look like an entirely new home. the customers were
satisfied and very grateful in the end.

Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
- when i was working for a smaller company they started exploring different areas further from our normal range. 
- i was responsible for installing the products they sold, usually attic insulation which attics get extremely hot in the summer.
- i should also mention that i am a night owl not a big fan of waking up early, but i got use to waking up at 4am and getting everything prepared for driving several hours
- this is when i found the ability to fake it as a morning bird, did not like it but it became a habbit.

Sometimes it’s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?
- balancing work and family has always felt that way to me, when going through codeworks i found i had little extra time between full time classes, daily assignments and
weekend applications to build. 
- there was a rather stressful application i was building over the weekend that required a lot more time than others, my family also wanted to go on a large exersion.
- i took all that i need to get done and listed it out, i planned on taking breaks when i could and go on the family exersion if i had enough completed.
- i finished the application and took a fair amount of breaks but i did miss the exersion because i did complete enough in time.

Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way at work.
- back when i was working for my business i was doing some sales and had an appointment with a not so promising potential customer.
- showing up to the appointment i found the husband rather than the wife confronting me and extremely upset that i wanted to sell them something they didnt need or want.
- i used every technique i had developed to talk him down and get him comfortable with me, i than transitioned to informing him more about what we did and how it worked.
- he eventually purchased our products and was extremely friendly towards us.

Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
- while i was working at walmarts DC they had extremely high turn over due to the difficulty oof the job and its high physical demand.
- they were also trying out new training for new recruits which didnt seem very effective
- i took it upon myself to stop and help them fix mistakes they were doing and give advise on how to do things better to avoid injury and improve productivity
- those that listened to my advise quickly excelled and had less mistakes.
