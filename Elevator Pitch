Let me tell you about myself, i come from a background in construction and business management. Every job ive done up to now ive excelled, i stand out to my employers because
of my work ethic and i quickly become a valued employee always out performing other employees. i had a job of orderfilling for walmarts DC,
everyday i went in and performed aboved that which was required and even above that which was compensated. Im a believer in hard work beyond compentation because hard work
benifits me just as much as my employeer. more recently i started a construction company, it was definately the hardeest thing ive ever done but also very rewarding. 
i built something from nothing, i had to learn sales techniques and communication skills that i never had to use before. i had to manage teams of employees and sales reps and
work with partners that had different views thanmyself. during this process i utilized excel to help manage my responsibilities and quickly fell in love with formulas, 
later covid hit and i had to rethink my career path. Upon much research i went to a software developer bootcamp and learned full-stack developement and loved every minute 
of that difficult learning process. I love the logical process of coding, i enjoy creating something from nothing and being proud of what i can do. 
coming from business management i know how important a good reliable employee is, i believe heavily in hard work wether its manual labor or coding.
I'm looking for something steady, consistent and reliable. I'm excited to be in a career of so many posibilities and infinate learning, im looking for a company that deserves my 
work ethic and one that i can give 100% to. Even if the company im with is more of a stepping stone than a permenate career, i will still give it my all.
