I come from a background in construction and business management. I tend to stand out as an employee due to my work ethic, I find fulfillment in working hard and going above
and beyond. A few years ago I started a construction company, I built something from nothing. I took on every role and I learned a ton about sales, communication, and effective
management. I utilized Excel to manage operations and remain organized, I became good at using formulas which I enjoyed for the problem solving aspects. Covid hit and I had to
pivot my career. I love the logical process of coding, I enjoy creating something from nothing and being proud of what I can do. I'm excited to be in a career with so many 
possibilities and infinite learning. I'm looking for a company that I can give my 110% to.
